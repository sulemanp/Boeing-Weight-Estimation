# Boeing 777-300ER Sizing



#Overview
  This project aimed to size a Boeing 777-300ER accurately at its Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) using basic aerodynamic relations and weight fraction theory. The aircraft was studied under a basic flight pattern, and a converged value was achieved within MATLAB. Convergence was performed by taking initial guesses between 333,000 and 1,000,000 lbs. Additionally, the required thrust at the converged value was also found.    

#Methods
      - Lift and Drag Theory
      - Weight Fraction Theory
#Results
      - (CL/CD) vs. Velocity at different initial guesses.
      - Calculated Takeoff Weight (final converged value for an initial guess) vs. initial guess.
      - Thrust vs. Velocity at an altitude of 45,000 ft.
## How to Run
      - Run 'project_1.m' in MATLAB.
