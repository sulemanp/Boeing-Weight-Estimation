# Boeing 777-300ER Sizing



#Overview
  This project aimed to size a Boeing 777-300ER accurately at its Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) using basic aerodynamic relations and weight fraction theory. The aircraft was studied under a basic flight pattern, and a converged value was achieved within MATLAB. Convergence was performed by taking initial guesses between 333,000 and 1,000,000 lbs. Additionally, the required thrust at the converged value was also found.
